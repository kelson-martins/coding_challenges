## Task 1

Assume a farmer can feed the animals using two different products, which have different nutritional composition and come at different costs as follows:


|Feed|Energy|Protein|Calcium|Cost|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|A|2|5|4|9|
|B|4|3|1|7|

In order to achieve the required quality of meat the farmer needs to ensure that the following minimum nutritional requirements are met:

Energy|Protein|Calcium|
|---|---|---|
12|15|8|

Define a Linear Program that optimises the cost of the mixture of feeds while at the same time meeting the minimum nutritional requirements.


## Task 2

Now assume that the above problem is a once-off decision only, so it is not about determining the optimal mixture of feed products but about determining how many units of each to buy to satisfy demand. The problem then is an Integer Linear Program, with the decision variables being integers.
Use a Mixed Integer Programming solver to solve the above problem and observe the difference.
