### Problem Definition

You find yourself on the shore of a river with a wolf, a sheep, and a cabbage. You can only take a maximum of one of these with you on the boat. Obviously you want to ferry all across, so you need to make multiple journeys back and forth. The problem is, if you leave the wolf and the sheep unattended, the wolf will eat the sheep. Also, if you leave the sheep and the cabbage alone on one shore, the sheep will have eaten the cabbage when you return.


### Your Task

Come up with a plan how to ferry all three over the river, never leaving wolf and sheep or sheep and cabbage unattended.
(Hint: it will take 8 crossings to reach the other side of the river with the sheep and the cabbage unharmed)
